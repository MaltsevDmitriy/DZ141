Vulnerability 1
Exposure
We found an instance of [vulnerability 1] by typing some relevant code into some vulnerable field OR by doing some edge-case thing.

By exploiting [this vulnerability], we were able to retrieve XYZ attributes from the site / access to some unauthorized part of the site / something else valuable.

Repair
problem_file1.py and problem_file2.py contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

problem_file1.py

Some body of relevant code that solves our problem
problem_file2.py


Vulnerability 1
Exposure
We found an instance of SQL Injection vulnerability in the file upload form (line 183 in views.py).

By exploiting this problem, we are able to perform SQL injection and retrieve data or drop tables from the database.

Repair
Rather than use a formatted SQL command with input from the form, the site should use the DJANGO ORM to create a File object instance for addition to the databse.

Problem Code (Lines 182 - 185, views.py):
curs = connection.cursor()
curs.execute(
    "insert into taskManager_file ('name','path','project_id') values ('%s','%s',%s)" %
    (name, upload_path, project_id))

Solution:
file = File(
name = name,
path = upload_path,
project = proj)

file.save()

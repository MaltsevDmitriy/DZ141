## Broken Auth
###Exposure
We found an a vulnerability for sql injection within the `upload` function in views.py. The code uses `curs.execute` which does not utilize any validation.

By Exploiting injection, we were able to name our project file `DROP TABLE user` which subsequently dropped all users from the database.

###Repair
In the Upload view, we replaced 
```
            curs.execute(
                "insert into taskManager_file ('name','path','project_id') values ('%s','%s',%s)" %
                (name, upload_path, project_id))
```
with 
```
            file = File(
                name=name,
                path=upload_path,
                project=proj)
            file.save()
```
because using curs.execute directly impacts the Django ORM and bypasses the built in checks. By using the common ORM, we ensure the file information is checked before it is submitted. We tested this with multiple injection attempts.

Many instances of Insecure Direct Object References. You can navigate to functions that should really be protected accessing a variety of routes.

/taskManager/profile/profile_id : access and edit existing user profiles, including admin (id=1)

/taskManager/downloadprofilepic/profile_id : view profile pictures

/taskManager/dashboard/ : access and edit any project and/or task

/taskManager/project_id/upload/ : access a project and upload a file

/taskManager/project_id/task_id : access projects and edit them

/taskManager/project_id/task_edit/task_id : access specific tasks and edit them

Repair

This is an example repair for the upload file to project view.

```python
def upload(request, project_id):

    if request.method == 'POST':

        user = request.user

        if user.is_authenticated():

            etc.
```

The user must be authenticated to successfully post. However, the user can still navigate to this page by url.

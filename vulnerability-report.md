### Find Vulnerabilities in nVisium Task Manager:

## Vulnerability 1 - SQL injection

This vulnerability allowed access and exploitation of the database, where it is possible to retrieve data or drop tables, due to raw SQL commands being used. 
The hashed database admin password was also accessible.

Running the SQL comman: ```INSERT INTO taskManager_file ('name','path','project_id') VALUES ('testPic',(SELECT password FROM auth_user WHERE username='admin'),8);--,...``` which allows the upload of the sensitive file as a "photo".


##Repair

To fix this vulnerability, use the Django ORM which handles malicious form inouts.  Avoid using direct ORM methods like curs.execute().

Specifically: 
``` 
file = File(name=name, path=upload_path, project=proj)
file.save()
```

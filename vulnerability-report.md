# Vunerability 1 - Injection

### Exposure

We found that if we were to upload a photo and passed SQL commands as the file name, we were able to make acual SQL commands on the backend. This allows use to view and compromise infomation that would considered sensitive. For example we used the file name:

```
adminPW',(select password from auth_user where username='admin'),2);--
```

we were able to view the admin's hashed password.

### Repair

views.py contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix it with the following adjustments. 

Removed:
```
curs = connection.cursor()
curs.execute(
    "insert into taskManager_file ('name','path','project_id') values ('%s','%s',%s)" %
    (name, upload_path, project_id))
```

and replaced it with:
```
file = File(
name = name,
path = upload_path,
project = proj)
file.save()
```

Reviewing nVisium Task Manager

Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection
Exposure:
When uploading a file to a project you can pass in sql commands and it will execute of done right because they uplaod a file using raw sql
Views.py contained the problem.  You are able to repair the file by using the object relational manager to properly escape user input:
Repair:
file_upload = File(name=name, path=upload_path, project=proj)
file_upload.save()

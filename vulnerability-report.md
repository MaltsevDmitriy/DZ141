### XSS

#### Exposure
The site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. By changing the
username, I was able to inject arbitrary HTML (and, through the
<script> tag, JS) into the page I was viewing. To test this, I set my
username to <script>alert('woops!')</script> and noticed that whenever
I refreshed the page, a dialog with "woops!" in it appeared.

#### Repair
In base_backend.html on line 58, the template marks user.username as
safe. By removing this, the problem is fixed. A number of other parts
of templates are innapropriately marked as safe, such as in
search.html, task.html, etc. For example, `{{ username|safe }}` should
simply be `{{ username }}`. The safe modifier should only be used when
one is absolutely sure the HTML being inserted is safe (e.g., if it
does not originate from user input at all).
